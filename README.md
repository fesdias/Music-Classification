# Music-Classification using Machine Learning models

Using the GTZAN Dataset [1] to create a model that predicts music genres with a simple pipeline, we resorted to literature to find what are the best technologies used today to solve this problem. The project was developed with the goal of reproducing the results obtained by previous researchers and thus perform the analysis of the results found. In the notebooks are the codes and results found when developing k-Nearest Neighbors model and Deep Neural Network ResNet50.
